## Requirements

This script requires [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/) with the [Tampermonkey extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) installed.

## Installation

To install Amazon Giveaway Bot, click [here](https://github.com/TyGooch/amazon-giveaway-bot/raw/master/amazonGiveawayBot.user.js). If Tampermonkey is correctly installed, you will be asked to add the script to your dashboard. Confirm the installation and start winning some giveaways.

## Usage

Once installed, ensure Tampermonkey is enabled and navigate to [https://www.amazon.com/giveaway/](https://www.amazon.com/giveaway/). Configure the options to your prefences and click start. The bot will run inside of an iframe until you click stop or close the page.

## Features

### CAPTCHA Solving

Support for solving captchas using the 2captcha API is now available. If you aren't a current customer please consider signing up using my [referral link](https://2captcha.com?from=7493321). Once you have a key, paste it into the 2Captcha API Key field in the settings panel and you're good to go.

### Multiple Accounts

Users can use different Amazon accounts on the same machine. History of entered giveaways is stored locally for each account to avoid revisiting giveaways previously entered. If you have more than one account added, the bot will automatically switch to another account after all giveaways are entered.

### Notifications

When you win a giveaway or all the current giveaways are entered you will be notified via a desktop notification.
